```
Stares at the corner where
two glass walls meet, almost
the exact point where the sun
sets.

Caught in the rise
of his people asking, probing
how and more and the descent
of his own someone seeking cuts.
He chooses the way
he’s been taught.

Looking
upward, knowing there’s little
reward in the daily, where
life is.
