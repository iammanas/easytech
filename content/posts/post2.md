## The Pursuit of Happiness

My father always told to me that the happiness of a person depends on the surrounding of that person. If a man lives with good people he will always be happy.

I left my hometown before my graduation and told all of them that I got an internship at Hyderabad but I don’t have. I started to learn software from my first year of graduation by myself but it needed to be sharpened so I came to Hyderabad. The software fever generated on me when I came to know about ML,Data Science and IOT.

The first phase here in Hyderabad is so hard for me because I have to travel 50 km up and down every day to my friends place so that I will learn more things from him. I have done that for almost 5 months.

My father taught me so many lessons from his Army life that helped me a lot here in Hyderabad. I didn’t ate afternoon lunch for so many days because that time I was staying in a rented room by myself so it’s hard to prepare food by myself and i can’t spend too much money everyday on food because i don’t want to beg more money to my parents anymore.

In the second phase here in Hyderabad I roamed a lot for the interviews but found rejected because I am a fresher. I don’t know why they are hiring so called fake experienced candidates instead of a fresher who is a inquisitive learner.

Finally i got selected in 2 companies(OMG how?)…One will give me training for 3 months with a basic salary and in another i have to learn by myself and after i will perform well then only i will be permanent. But i selected the second one because i loved the environment from the first day. I was a fan of this company even before my arrival to Hyderabad.

During my graduation time onward i followed one employee of this company and his name is Uday. That time i asked him about any vacancy but they don’t have any that time.

I know how i spent my days and nights during the process of interview(Almost it took 1 months to complete all the process) and i didn’t slept fully during this time. I always used to check my mail 100 times a day and replied a lot of time to Vinisha mam, even i wrote poetry also. I joined and working on some projects and found these people are more amazing than what i thought. How can a CEO will replay a trainee?. But whatever i am loving it.

I don’t know why god made me like this but i am kind of a furious and my Adrenalin is always high for something. So for this company…..To be continued….
