      <description>The Pursuit of Happiness My father always told to me that the happiness of a person depends on the surrounding of that person. If a man lives with good people he will always be happy.
I left my hometown before my graduation and told all of them that I got an internship at Hyderabad but I don’t have. I started to learn software from my first year of graduation by myself but it needed to be sharpened so I came to Hyderabad.</description>

Django models are the base thing of any django project.The main purpose of django models are to save the user data in to any database(sqlite3,MongoDB,Oracle,PostgreSQL etc)</description>
